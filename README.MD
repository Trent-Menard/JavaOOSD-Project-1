### Bless, Eclipse can now understand it.
#### During import from Git, Eclipse was using old eml/iml/.classpath/.project files. Removed them.

Import into to Eclipse:
1. Via Git Clone:
   - File
   - Import
   - Git
   - Projects From Git (with smart import)
   - Clone URI
2. Via Folder
   - Extract Zip
   - File
   - Import
   - Maven
   - Existing Maven Projects
   - Select Folder

Note: Saving Shows properly wasn't completed in original submission (nor this one, to be fair to others).
Should time permit, I may fix the file I/O (though for fun; not graded :D)
