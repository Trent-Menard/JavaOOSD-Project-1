### Written in IntelliJ (Eclipse can open directly) or I can convert it to a eclipse project if needed.

1. From Eclipse:
    - File
    - Import
    - Git
    - Projects From Git (with smart import)
    - Clone URI

File to read is embedded within jar at the moment - not too big of an issue b/c saving wasn't completed in original submission (nor this one, to be fair to others).
Should time permit, I may do some modifcations to fix file I/O (though for fun; not graded :D)
